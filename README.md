# WinAPI-MalDev
My intro to making Windows API calls to develop windows based malware. I wanted to expand my understanding of C++ and Malware Development so I created this project. The code is incredibly simple and any AV, let alone any EDR, should pick it up almost instantly. Looking to learn evasion techniques and dive deeper in the future.
